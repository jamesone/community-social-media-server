#About
Rest API built with express for serving the http & sequelize for all the databse query and modeling.

I've had to hack Sequelize a bit to get what I wanted it to do :) 

As mentioned in my `community-social-media-app` repo, I only started building this to have a bit of fun!

#AWS
I got this running on AWS but then took it down as I wasn't working on the app anymore. 

- I had it saving photos to S3 and had everything being cached using AWS
- Got the app running on Elasticbeanstalk
